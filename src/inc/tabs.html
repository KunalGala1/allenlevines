          Allen LeVines&rsquo; compositions connect cultures of distinctly
          different origins through the language of the music, encouraging
          audiences to realize a shared humanity. He is a highly decorated
          composer distinguished with the American Academy Award and
          international prizes in Japan, Holland, Greece, and Switzerland. His
          instrumental, orchestral, and choral works have been performed
          throughout the United States, Europe and Japan.
        </div>
        <p>
          LeVines&rsquo; first composition studies came at Stetson University
          with the mentor Paul Langston. At the University of Pennsylvania,
          LeVines thrived while working with two peerless composers - George
          Crumb and George Rochberg. Equally influential composition studies
          took place with George Perle, as well as brief work with Toru
          Takemitsu, both at Tanglewood.
        </p>
        <p>
          While at Penn, LeVines was already seeking experiences and ideas
          beyond Euro-American traditions, leading to studies in Japanese
          <em>gagaku</em>
          with Sensei Suenobi Togi and Ghanaian drumming with Torgbui Midawo
          Gideon Foli Alorwoyie. Additionally, Olivier Messiaen&rsquo;s
          influence nurtured a growing respect for the resources of birdsong.
        </p>
        <p>
          Allen LeVines&rsquo; music creates unexpected soundscapes,
          interweaving innovations and traditions from around the globe. His
          influences spring from literature, art, mathematics, philosophy,
          mysticism. The music is pluralistic, drawing inspiration from East
          Asia, Africa, India, European composition schools in the succession
          Messiaen, rock, jazz, Chinese
          <em>wuxing</em>
          , and Japanese poetry.
        </p>
        <p>
          Immersed in jazz, classical, world, and experimental music, LeVines
          has collaborated with brilliant artists from a dynamic stylistic
          spectrum - multi-wind virtuoso Yazhi Guo (China), mandolin-guitar team
          Mare Duo (Germany), Z<span class="star-symbol">*</span>A Performance
          Ensemble (Japan), Portland String Quartet (United States), jazz and
          bluegrass violinist Matt Glaser (United States), pianist Gwendolyn Mok
          (United States), vocalist Marina Khankhalaeva (Buryatia), and more.
          His
          <em>Imago-Legend</em>
          was performed by the St. Louis Symphony under Leonard Slatkin and
          <em>Velocities</em>
          was performed by new music ensemble Alea III with Theodore Antonio.
          Other notable performances include
          <em>Daybreak on Lake Bosomtwe</em>
          for Plectrum Orchestra and Percussion (JZO JugendZupfOrchester,
          Germany),
          <em>Mad Verse-Withering Wind</em>
          for dancer, vocalist, and piano (Z<span class="star-symbol">*</span>A
          Performance Ensemble),
          <em>after the quake</em>
          for mandolin and guitar (Mare Duo), and
          <em>
            Travel Journal: Books
            <span style="white-space: nowrap">I&mdash;III</span>
          </em>
          (Portland String Quartet).

          Among Allen LeVines&rsquo; earliest musical memories are hearing
          Ellington, Porter, and Gershwin songs his mother sang and played.
          School jazz, orchestra, and chorus directors supported LeVines&rsquo;
          broad passions for Hendrix, The Beatles, and BS&T together with
          Vivaldi, Mussorgsky, and Debussy. By age twenty, LeVines had formed a
          folk-rock ensemble, a jazz-rock vocal group, conducted classical
          choruses, and performed with a Miami Beach big band.
        </div>

        <p>
          LeVines&rsquo; musical curiosity was further nurtured in college. At
          Stetson University under mentors Paul Langston and Virginia Hutchings,
          he focused on solo keyboard works of Bach, Beethoven, Chopin, and
          Rachmaninoff. Jazz piano studies with Harold Blancher opened
          LeVines&rsquo; world to the genius of Waller, Monk, Evans, and Simone.
          While in graduate studies at the University of Pennsylvania, LeVines
          performed in Philadelphia and New York area jazz venues in duo
          settings with a small network of progressive improv and jazz scene
          musicians.
        </p>
        <p>
          LeVines&rsquo; early jazz and rock influences drew him toward more and
          more adventurous sonic possibilities, and in tandem with experimental
          composition he has recently returned full circle to performing jazz
          and classical piano. Marina Khankhalaeva (vocals) and Allen LeVines
          (piano) currently form an accomplished, classy duo. Bringing together
          contemporary and international influences, their shows wrap audiences
          in a warm fabric of harmonies and invite listeners deeply into the
          music where sounds full of color are waiting to be discovered.

          As both a private teacher and a Berklee College of Music professor,
          LeVines mentors a range of performers and composers, guiding each
          toward developing a personal voice. For a college-wide curriculum
          review, he was chosen as a chair of a panel on music history. He has
          designed an array of courses including studies in the Music of Japan,
          Music of China and the Music of Olivier Messiaen.

          LeVines&rsquo; advanced studies in music included conducting with
          Geoffrey Gilbert and Robert Rich. A versatile conductor, LeVines
          directs ensembles in an array of chamber, choral, and opera
          performances. His repertoire includes gospel, South African freedom
          songs, and classical Baroque concerti and cantatas.
        </div>

        <p>
          For twenty-five seasons LeVines served as Music Director for
          Stämbandet, a vocal ensemble acclaimed as both an a cappella group and
          a world music vocal group. The fifteen accomplished singers from
          Scandinavia performed in six languages, presenting folk traditions
          unique to Scandinavia, including
          <em>trall</em>
          - singers imitating fiddlers playing dance music - a practice often
          compared to scat singing. LeVines travelled in Sweden in 1994 on a
          SVEA International grant, researching the connection between folk song
          forms and fiddle music. Stämbandet's concerts presented songs rarely
          heard outside of Europe&rsquo;s Nordic countries. Appearing on stage,
          radio, and television, in 2010 the ensemble toured Sweden.
