    <p>
      For Allen LeVines, music is in every place at every moment -- in
      scatterings of morning sun or night shadows, thundering spring waterfalls
      or silent winter snows, prancing unbridled horses or petals drooping on
      dew-soaked wildflowers. Music is natural and sacred, physical and
      metaphysical, ravishing and contemplative.
    </p>
    <p>
      LeVines is a musician inspired by a global vision, embracing the vast and
      compelling array of sounds every culture world-wide has to offer. A
      seasoned composer, pianist, and conductor, his compositions have been
      described as &quot;atmospheric&quot;, his jazz piano as
      &quot;authentic&quot;, and his artistic direction as
      &quot;illuminating&quot;. LeVines&rsquo; ongoing multi-cultural studies
      include Japanese gagaku, West African drumming, Andean flute traditions,
      and more.
