              <em>Daybreak on Lake Bosomtwe</em>
              imagines day beginning on a large lake in Ghana formed from a
              meteorite&rsquo;s impact. The first part consists of an
              atmospheric slow introduction, with swelling tremolos over
              mysterious, deep chord clusters, birdsong, and passages of
              expectant silence the moment in which the night begins to give way
              to the first weak light day and life awakening on Lake Bosomtwe*.
              An impression of nature with an atmosphere full of surprises.
            </p>
            <p class="item">
              The second part is based on traditional drum rhythms from Ghana.
              The music&rsquo;s extremely complex rhythmic shifts form a
              polyrhythmic network in different meters. While soli mandolins and
              shaker speed the orchestra on inexorably, the guitars remain
              pizzicato for some time, so that an interesting tonal effect is
              reached. Layered on the fabric of Ghanaian rhythms LeVines
              superimposes the sonorities of the shō from Japanese gagaku, the
              traditional court music of the aristocracy. The shō is seemingly
              unusual for this music &mdash; a wind instrument which produces 5-
              to 6-note sound clusters &mdash; yet merges well into this
              pluralistic mix, and again illustrates LeVines&rsquo;
              understanding of music as diverse cultures&rsquo; connecting art
              form.

              * Lake Bosomtwe is Ghana&rsquo;s only natural lake, with a
              diameter of over 6 miles, and hills of the crater rim reaching
              over 2000 feet. It is considered sacred, and according to
              traditional belief the souls of the dead come to the lake to bid
              farewell to the god Twe. The intact primary rainforest and a rich
              biodiversity remain untouched in the Ekoho area, although
              destroyed today in many parts of the basin. Preservation is
              deserved and needed, and currently there are attempts to declare
              Lake Bosomtwe a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Site.
