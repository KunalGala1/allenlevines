                Idylls is a three-movement cantata representing afternoon,
                evening, and morning in New England, set to poems of Ralph Waldo
                Emerson, Theodore Roethke, and Mary Oliver. LeVines clusters
                complex rhythms and tonal colors -- serene or syncopated,
                peaceful or riveting -- covering a broad dynamic spectrum. The
                work concludes in an exuberant climax emerging from a choral
                tapestry which recalls the three individual movements texturally
                and musically.

                  Wood-Gods
                  <p>
                    Because I was content with these poor fields,
                    <br />
                    Low open meads, slender and sluggish streams,
                    <br />
                    And found a home in haunts which others scorned,
                    <br />
                    The partial wood-gods overpaid my love,
                    <br />
                    And granted me the freedom of their state,
                    <br />
                    And in their secret senate have prevailed
                    <br />
                    With the dear dangerous lords that rule our life,
                    <br />
                    Made moon and planets parties to their bond,
                    <br />
                    And pitying through my solitary wont
                    <br />
                    Shot million rays of thought and tenderness.
                    <br />
                    For me in showers, in sweeping showers, the spring
                    <br />
                    Visits the valley:—break away the clouds,
                    <br />
                    I bathe in the morn's soft and silvered air,
                    <br />
                    And loiter willing by yon loitering stream.

                    The small birds swirl around;
                    <br />
                    The high cicadas chirr;
                    <br />
                    A towhee pecks the ground;
                    <br />
                    I look at the first star:
                    <br />
                    My heart held to its joy,
                    <br />
                    This whole September day.

                    <br />
                    The moon goes to the full;
                    <br />
                    The moon goes slowly down;
                    <br />
                    The wood becomes a wall.
                    <br />
                    Far things draw closer in.
                    <br />
                    A wind moves through the grass,
                    <br />
                    Then all is as it was.

                    <br />
                    What rustles in the fern?
                    <br />
                    I feel my flesh divide.
                    <br />
                    Things lost in sleep return
                    <br />
                    As if out of my side,
                    <br />
                    On feet that make no sound
                    <br />
                    Over the sodden ground.
                    <br />

                    <br />
                    The small shapes drowse; I live
                    <br />
                    To woo the fearful small;
                    <br />
                    What moves in grass I love—
                    <br />
                    The dead will not lie still,
                    <br />
                    And things throw light on things,
                    <br />
                    And all the stones have wings.

                  Morning (Morning at Great Pond)
                  <p>
                    It starts like this:
                    <br />
                    forks of light
                    <br />
                    slicking up
                    <br />
                    out of the east,
                    <br />
                    flying over you,
                    <br />
                    and what&rsquo;s left of the night--
                    <br />
                    its black waterfalls,
                    <br />
                    its craven doubt--
                    <br />
                    dissolves like gravel
                    <br />
                    as the sun appears
                    <br />
                    trailing clouds
                    <br />
                    of pink and green wool,
                    <br />
                    igniting the fields,
                    <br />
                    turning the ponds
                    <br />
                    to plates of fire.
                    <br />
                    The creatures there
                    <br />
                    are dark flickerings
                    <br />
                    you make out
                    <br />
                    one by one
                    <br />
                    as the light lifts--
                    <br />
                    great blue herons,
                    <br />
                    wood ducks shaking
                    <br />
                    their shimmering crests--
                    <br />
                    and knee-deep
                    <br />
                    in the purple shallows
                    <br />
                    a deer drinking:
                    <br />
                    as she turns
                    <br />
                    the silver water
                    <br />
                    crushed like silk,
                    <br />
                    shaking the sky,
                    <br />
                    and you're healed then
                    <br />
                    from the night, your heart
                    <br />
                    wants more, you are ready
                    <br />
                    to rise and look!
                    <br />
                    to hurry anywhere!
                    <br />
                    to believe in everything.
